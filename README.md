# INTRODUCTION
	
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects a person’s ability to control movement. The patient suffers from tremor, slow
movements, trouble walking and maintaining body balance, stiffness of arms and legs. As the disease worsens there will be issues in sleeping which may cause mental and
memory problems and behavioral changes. Also, the drawing speed will be slow and the pen pressure is low among Parkinson’s patients as it is difficult to draw smooth
spirals and waves.   In this disease, the cells of the substantia nigra start to die. When this happens, dopamine levels are reduced. When they have dropped 60 to 80
percent, symptoms of Parkinson’s start to appear. 

To detect the Parkinson's disease is a tedious process. More than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease unknowingly. According to
studies, men are 50% more prone to the disease than women. This disease is most common among the 60+ age category. Unfortunately, this cannot be cured but, early
detection along with proper medication can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life. 

# Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning

The main reason for Parkinson’s Disease is due to abnormal loss of neurons. The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure is low
among the patients. One of the indications of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it difficult to draw smooth spirals and waves. It is possible
to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone instead of measuring the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. This project aims at quantifying the visual
appearance using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients method, where the drawings are trained and tested using Machine Learning Model and they are further classified
using Convolutional Neural Network. Later, we use the Random Forest classifier to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.
